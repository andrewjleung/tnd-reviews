# tnd-reviews

Dataset containing most of TheNeedleDrop's reviews with scores for use however you want. Live updated via [andrewjleung/fantano-reviews](https://github.com/andrewjleung/fantano-reviews).

Example basic analysis of average ratings by genres can be found in [analysis/fantano_genre.ipynb](https://github.com/andrewjleung/tnd-reviews/blob/main/analysis/fantano_genre.ipynb) (TL;DR he likes industrial).

## Note on Completeness

In its current state, this dataset is not 100% complete in terms of having every TheNeedleDrop review there is, though updates are being made to the review parser to achieve this.

The goal of this dataset is to have parity with [AOTY's list](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/publication/57-the-needle-drop/) along with other types of reviews including NOT GOOD, NOT BAD, and classic reviews.
